 * This thing used to be named simply 'GenericDao' in versions of appfuse prior to 2.0.
 * It was renamed in an attempt to distinguish and describe it as something 
 * different than GenericDao.  GenericDao is intended for subclassing, and was
 * named Generic because 1) it has very general functionality and 2) is 
 * 'generic' in the Java 5 sense of the word... aka... it uses Generics.
 * 
 * Implementations of this class are not intended for subclassing. You most
 * likely would want to subclass GenericDao.  The only real difference is that 
 * instances of java.lang.Class are passed into the methods in this class, and 
 * they are part of the constructor in the GenericDao, hence you'll have to do 
 * some casting if you use this one.
